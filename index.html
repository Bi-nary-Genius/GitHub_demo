    <h1>Unicorns Among Us: Discovering the Enchanted Truth</h1>
    <img src="./unicorn.jpeg" alt="Unicorn Image" />
    <p>
      In a forest where magic's the norm, Lived Sherie the unicorn, never
      forlorn. She'd dance with delight, Under moon's silver light, And prank
      trolls with her sparkly horn. One day Sherie played tricks on a gnome, Who
      built his small house in a dome. He woke up in fright, To rainbows so
      bright, Now his garden's their colorful home!
